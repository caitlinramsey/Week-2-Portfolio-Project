# cr-design-portfolio-project

This portfolio project was to demonstrate our understanding and abilied with HTML and CSS. We were tasked with creating a similar webpage to the example provided to us. We were given no code to start with and had to write it all ourselves. 

I personalized it with the colors, font, and pictures that I wanted in order to make this final product. The following screenshot is my final published portfolio website.
