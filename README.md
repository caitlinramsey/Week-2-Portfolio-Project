# Caitlin Ramsey Portfolio 

## Description
This portfolio project was to demonstrate our understanding and abilities with HTML and CSS. We were tasked with creating a similar webpage to the example provided to us. We were given no starter code. The website needed to have about me, work, contact me, and resume sections. The about me, work, and contact me sections needed to have clickable links in the header which would take you to the part of the page they were in when clicked. The resume link in the header, takes the user to a separate html page with the resume on it. I added links to the contact section so when clicked, they take the user to the appropriate website or mail app.

I personalized it with the colors, font, and pictures that I wanted in order to make this final product. The following screenshots demonstrate my final published portfolio website.
